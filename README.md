- **Feature packed:** customizable collision detection algorithms, multiple activators, draggable overlay, drag handles, auto-scrolling, constraints, and so much more.
- **Built for React:** exposes hooks such as [`useDraggable`](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/draggable) and [`useDroppable`](https://docs.dndkit.com/api-documentation/droppable). and won't force you to re-architect your app or create additional wrapper DOM nodes.
- **Supports a wide range of use cases:** lists, grids, multiple containers, nested contexts, variable sized items, virtualized lists, 2D Games, and more.
- **Zero dependencies and modular:** the core of the library weighs around 10kb minified and has no external dependencies. It's built around built-in React state management and context, which keeps the library lean.
- **Built-in support for multiple input methods:** Pointer, mouse, touch and keyboard sensors.
- **Fully customizable & extensible:** Customize every detail: animations, transitions, behaviours, styles. Build your own sensors, collision detection algorithms, customize key bindings and so much more.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard support, sensible default aria attributes, customizable screen reader instructions and live regions built-in.
- **Performance:** It was built with performance in mind in order to support silky smooth animations.
- **Presets:** Need to build a sortable interface? Check out `@dnd-kit/sortable`, which is a thin layer built on top of `@dnd-kit/core`. More presets coming in the future.
